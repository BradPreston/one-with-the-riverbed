Since forming in 2017, the band has strived to push the boundaries of the genre by incorporating elements of atmospheric black metal with dissonant textures and dynamic shifts. Absence, the bandâ€™s first full-length album following an EP in 2018, garnered international attention upon its release in 2021, earning accolades from publications such as Metal Hammer, No Clean Singing, and Toilet ov Hell. </p>
