				"excerpt": "ONE WITH THE RIVERBED is a five-piece Post-Metal band from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Since forming in 2017, the band has strived to push the boundaries of the genre by incorporating elements of Atmospheric Black Metal with ambient soundscapes, dissonant textures, and dynamic shifts. “Absence,” the band’s first full-length album following an EP in 2018, showcases these sonic progressions while exploring overarching themes of death and loss. Throughout the album, the band develops both lyrical and musical motifs to build cohesion and provide resolution. It is uncompromising in scope yet concise in delivery. The album contains five tracks."

				"excerpt": "While dripping in cold and heartless ambience, the first track certainly leans more towards the black metal side of things. A raw style of black metal; the vocals howl like a wind blowing through a mountain passage, the guitars are sharp and bloodying, and the percussion has that tinny, old-school vibe that always works in this environment. At times, the embodiment of black metal but with shifts and twists that take things in a brand-new and often exciting direction."
